# Dotfiles

I'm using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to stow my files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexvyber/dotfiles.git $HOME
cd dotfiles
stow home # stowing dotfiles
```

## What's inside?
- tmux + tmuxp
- alacritty
- oh-my-zsh
- bunch of aliases and custom functions
- some scripts written in bash, js or python

## Systems 
I use these files on Linux and MacOS
